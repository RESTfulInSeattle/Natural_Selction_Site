#### A great DJ plays the right song at the right time

No event and crowd are the same. You need a seasoned professional to both keep the event on schedule, and the crowd entertained with music that speaks to them.

With 20 years of experience in playing everything from nightclubs, weddings, corporate events, fundraisers, lounges, casinos, and Outdoor Races, Dave Clayton has the experience and passion to make your event a success! Feel free to use the contact form, call, or text 206-851-0003 to obtain a quote for your event.

Sound and Lighting can be scaled up and down to your needs and venue size.

- 2 Simultaneous wireless microphones, with the option of 2 hand held mics, 2 lapel mics, or one of each.
- 3 Separate audio zones, for example a high fidelity ceremonyÂ  sound system, a discrete cocktail system, and subwoofer reinforced reception sound system.
- A subwoofer reinforced venue sound system with digital audio processing to adapt to the size and acoustics of the venue.
- Dance lighting that moves to the beat of the music, and static or color changing up-lighting to enhance the atmosphere of the venue.
