You've completed that mix or album you live for, and now you need mastering to push your vision further. Dave Clayton will assure your mix translates, and makes an impact, on any system played.

He creates high quality MP3s mastered to accommodate for their compression to that format, as well as a lossless delivery of .WAV, FLAC, or Apple Lossless. He offers full Redbook compliant CD creation, SRC codes, CD Text, and DDP 2.0 with CD Text Addendum.

Mastering is the last chance for your project before delivery. You get an un-biased critical ear in an acoustically neutral environment with world class digital mastering technology.
