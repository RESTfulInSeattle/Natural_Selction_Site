Natural Selection Compact 15” Subwoofer 1,000 Watts RMS, 4” Voice Coil, 8 Ohms
Concept
I remember coming across the webpage of a speaker aficionado&rsquo;s personal mission, to expose the frequency fraud of a high end manufacturer&rsquo;s Acoustimass home theater system. He proved that the subwoofer in the system wouldn&rsquo;t produce frequencies below 40Hz. That was definitely not low enough for home theater, but the system still sounded loud, even with its small 6&quot; woofers, and compact enclosure.">

<h4 id="concept">Concept</h4>
<p>I remember coming across the webpage of a speaker aficionado&rsquo;s personal mission, to expose the frequency fraud of a high end manufacturer&rsquo;s Acoustimass home theater system. He proved that the subwoofer in the system wouldn&rsquo;t produce frequencies below 40Hz. That was definitely not low enough for home theater, but the system still sounded loud, even with its small 6&quot; woofers, and compact enclosure.</p>
<p>The NSC15 started with the concept of a small, but loud system. To maximize the loudness from the sub amp&rsquo;s power, it would be high-passed at 40 Hz. A Dayton Audio 15&quot; woofer, with the above specs, was selected. There would be two NSC15 wired parallel to an amp that provides 2,000 Watts in bridged mono, to 4 Ohms.</p>
<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
<p>• A vented enclosure was chosen to maximize loudness.<br>
• The vent needs to be tuned at a certain frequency, and the lower that frequency, the bigger the enclosure needs to be.<br>
• The lower the frequency of a sound, the more energy is required to reproduce it from an amplifier. The human ear&rsquo;s lowest audible frequency is 30 Hz.<br>
• A relatively high frequency of 37 Hz was chosen to keep the enclosure smaller, not surpass the mechanical limits of the chosen woofer, and put more of the amplifier&rsquo;s energy into loudness.<br>
• Freeware WinISD was used to calculate the volume, and port dimensions, based on the Dayton woofer&rsquo;s specs.</p>

<p>Calculating the required volume of the enclosure, 3.16 ft3, based on the tuning frequency of the port, 37 Hz. Then<br>
calculating the dimensions of the vent, and its distortion.</p>
<h4 id="building">Building</h4>
<p>The above 3d model was made to visualize the enclosure that would satisfy the calculated volume, have the correct vent dimensions, and be compact. For speaker design and building expertise, I turned to Shaun of Chico, CA&rsquo;s Get Down Sound. He made sure to add bracing, and utilized his experience to make the design a reality.</p>
